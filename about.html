            <p class="p1-a">My name is <i>Adel Aziza Useni.</i>I am from D.R. Congo and came to the US to pursue my goal of having my degree in Application Development.
                I started my journey in winter 2017 and I kept working hard to increase my knowledge to be an expert on what I like to do be in the future.
                Since I was a little girl, I usually want to be the first girl to have high education in my family. Coming from a culture where women are born to get married and give children, it has been a challenge for me to travel and be educated. However, my parents are working hard so that I can have a better education and encourage me to achieve my goals.  I completed my high school in 2015. Although our tradition believes about women, I want to distinguish myself in my community by having a degree in Web development and become a teacher of programming that are the career goals that I want to obtain.</p><br><br>
                <p class="p2-a">My goal was to finish my four years at BC and later transfer to Washington University to have my master's degree. I took different steps to reach my goals.<br>
                First, I used various resources on campus to keep learning and share with students who have more experience than me on certain subjects.
                Since technology is getting better, it is essential to keep learning every day. For example, I often talked to my professor who gave me some subjection on how to be an expert and increase knowledge which was having time to practice. Second, by getting involved in different organizations that use data and technology to practice and increase more knowledge, it helped  to reinforce my experience and to have a clear view on how I can be able to use what I learned at my workplace.</p>
