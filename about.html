            <p class="p1">My name is <i>Adel Aziza Useni.</i>I am from D.R. Congo and came to the US to pursue my goal of having my degree in Application Development.
                I started my journey in winter 2017 and I kept working hard to increase my knowledge to be an expert on what I like to do be in the future.<br><br>
                My goal was to finish my four years at BC and later transfer to Washington University to have my master's degree. I took different steps to reach my goals.<br>
                First, I used various resources on campus to keep learning and share with students who have more experience than me on certain subjects.
                Since technology is getting better, it is essential to keep learning every day. For example, I often talked to my professor who gave me some subjection on how to be an expert and increase knowledge which was having time to practice. Second, by getting involved in different organizations that use data and technology to practice and increase more knowledge, it helped  to reinforce my experience and to have a clear view on how I can be able to use what I learned at my workplace.</p>
